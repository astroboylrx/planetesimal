============

This is a one dimensional (on a mass grid) simulation code to realize the time evolution of boulder size distribution near the inner boundary of protoplanetary disks which is determined by coagulation, fragmentation and gravitational instability. Actually, for now, the gravitational instability could not be implemented very well.
