planetesimal
============

This is a one dimensional (on a mass grid) simulation code to realize the time evolution of boulder (or planetesimal) size distribution near the inner boundary of protoplanetary disks which is determined by coagulation, fragmentation and gravitational interaction. This code is implemented using MPI library, so it is able to using multiple CPU cores.
